This study suggests Deep Learning Architectures (DLA) to classify birds based on their species. To extract features from birdimages,
I utilized two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Transfer learning models, 
InceptionResNetV2 and MobileNetV2 combined with two shallow constructed CNN architectures of input_sizes of (160x160 and 224x224).
